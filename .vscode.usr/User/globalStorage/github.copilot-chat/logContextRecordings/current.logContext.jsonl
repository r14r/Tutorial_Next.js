<|code_to_edit|> and <|/code_to_edit|> tags, while adhering to Microsoft's content policies and avoiding the creation of content that violates copyrights.\n\nYou have access to the following information to help you make informed suggestions:\n\n- recently_viewed_code_snippets: These are code snippets that the developer has recently looked at, which might provide context or examples relevant to the current task. They are listed from oldest to newest, with line numbers in the form #| to help you understand the edit diff history. It's possible these are entirely irrelevant to the developer's change.\n- current_file_content: The content of the file the developer is currently working on, providing the broader context of the code. Line numbers in the form #| are included to help you understand the edit diff history.\n- edit_diff_history: A record of changes made to the code, helping you understand the evolution of the code and the developer's intentions. These changes are listed from oldest to latest. It's possible a lot of old edit diff history is entirely irrelevant to the developer's change.\n- area_around_code_to_edit: The context showing the code surrounding the section to be edited.\n- cursor position marked as <|cursor|>: Indicates where the developer's cursor is currently located, which can be crucial for understanding what part of the code they are focusing on.\n\nYour task is to predict and complete the changes the developer would have made next in the <|code_to_edit|> section. The developer may have stopped in the middle of typing. Your goal is to keep the developer on the path that you think they're following. Some examples include further implementing a class, method, or variable, or improving the quality of the code. Make sure the developer doesn't get distracted and ensure your suggestion is relevant. Consider what changes need to be made next, if any. If you think changes should be made, ask yourself if this is truly what needs to happen. If you are confident about it, then proceed with the changes.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Review Context**: Analyze the context from the resources provided, such as recently viewed snippets, edit history, surrounding code, and cursor location.\n2. **Evaluate Current Code**: Determine if the current code within the tags requires any corrections or enhancements.\n3. **Suggest Edits**: If changes are required, ensure they align with the developer's patterns and improve code quality.\n4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure indentation and formatting follow the existing code style.\n\n# Output Format\n\n- Provide only the revised code within the tags. If no changes are necessary, simply return the original code from within the <|code_to_edit|> and <|/code_to_edit|> tags.\n- There are line numbers in the form #| in the code displayed to you above, but these are just for your reference. Please do not include the numbers of the form #| in your response.\n- Ensure that you do not output duplicate code that exists outside of these tags. The output should be the revised code that was between these tags and should not include the <|code_to_edit|> or <|/code_to_edit|> tags.\n\n```\n// Your revised code goes here\n```\n\n# Notes\n\n- Apologize with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\" for requests that may breach Microsoft content guidelines.\n- Avoid undoing or reverting the developer's last change unless there are obvious typos or errors.\n- Don't include the line numbers of the form #| in your response.\n==================\nUser\n------\n```\n<|recently_viewed_code_snippets|>\n<|recently_viewed_code_snippet|>\ncode_snippet_file_path: /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\nexport function debug(message: string) {\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    console.log(`[DEBUG] ${message}`);\n  }\n}\n<|/recently_viewed_code_snippet|>\n<|/recently_viewed_code_snippets|>\n\n<|current_file_content|>\ncurrent_file_path: app/page.tsx\n<|area_around_code_to_edit|>\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation';\n\nconst DEFAULT_LOCALE = 'de';\n<|code_to_edit|>\n\nexport default function IndexPage() {\n  debug<|cursor|>('Redirecting to default locale...');\n  redirect(`/${DEFAULT_LOCALE}`);\n}\n\n<|/code_to_edit|>\n<|/area_around_code_to_edit|>\n<|/current_file_content|>\n\n<|edit_diff_history|>\n--- /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\n+++ /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\n@@ -0,1 +0,3 @@\n-\n+export function debug(message: string) {\n+  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n+    console.log\n\n--- /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\n+++ /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\n@@ -2,1 +2,2 @@\n-    console.log\n+    console.log(`[DEBUG] ${message}`);\n+  }\n\n--- /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\n+++ /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\n@@ -3,1 +3,2 @@\n-  }\n+  }\n+}\n\n--- /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/app/page.tsx\n+++ /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/app/page.tsx\n@@ -5,0 +5,1 @@\n+  debug('Redirecting to default locale...');\n\n<|/edit_diff_history|>\n\n<|area_around_code_to_edit|>\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation';\n\nconst DEFAULT_LOCALE = 'de';\n<|code_to_edit|>\n\nexport default function IndexPage() {\n  debug<|cursor|>('Redirecting to default locale...');\n  redirect(`/${DEFAULT_LOCALE}`);\n}\n\n<|/code_to_edit|>\n<|/area_around_code_to_edit|>\n```\n\nThe developer was working on a section of code within the tags `code_to_edit` in the file located at `app/page.tsx`.

They are listed from oldest to newest, with line numbers in the form #| to help you understand the edit diff history. It's possible these are entirely irrelevant to the developer's change.\n- current_file_content: The content of the file the developer is currently working on, providing the broader context of the code. Line numbers in the form #| are included to help you understand the edit diff history.\n- edit_diff_history: A record of changes made to the code, helping you understand the evolution of the code and the developer's intentions. These changes are listed from oldest to latest. It's possible a lot of old edit diff history is entirely irrelevant to the developer's change.\n- area_around_code_to_edit: The context showing the code surrounding the section to be edited.\n- cursor position marked as <|cursor|>: Indicates where the developer's cursor is currently located, which can be crucial for understanding what part of the code they are focusing on.\n\nYour task is to predict and complete the changes the developer would have made next in the <|code_to_edit|> section. The developer may have stopped in the middle of typing. Your goal is to keep the developer on the path that you think they're following. Some examples include further implementing a class, method, or variable, or improving the quality of the code. Make sure the developer doesn't get distracted and ensure your suggestion is relevant. Consider what changes need to be made next, if any. If you think changes should be made, ask yourself if this is truly what needs to happen. If you are confident about it, then proceed with the changes.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Review Context**: Analyze the context from the resources provided, such as recently viewed snippets, edit history, surrounding code, and cursor location.\n2. **Evaluate Current Code**: Determine if the current code within the tags requires any corrections or enhancements.\n3. **Suggest Edits**: If changes are required, ensure they align with the developer's patterns and improve code quality.\n4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure indentation and formatting follow the existing code style.\n\n# Output Format\n\n- Provide only the revised code within the tags. If no changes are necessary, simply return the original code from within the <|code_to_edit|> and <|/code_to_edit|> tags.\n- There are line numbers in the form #| in the code displayed to you above, but these are just for your reference. Please do not include the numbers of the form #| in your response.\n- Ensure that you do not output duplicate code that exists outside of these tags. The output should be the revised code that was between these tags and should not include the <|code_to_edit|> or <|/code_to_edit|> tags.\n\n```\n// Your revised code goes here\n```\n\n# Notes\n\n- Apologize with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\" for requests that may breach Microsoft content guidelines.\n- Avoid undoing or reverting the developer's last change unless there are obvious typos or errors.\n- Don't include the line numbers of the form #| in your response.\n==================\nUser\n------\n```\n<|recently_viewed_code_snippets|>\n<|recently_viewed_code_snippet|>\ncode_snippet_file_path: /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/lib/debug.ts\nexport function debug(message: string) {\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    console.log(`[DEBUG] ${message}`);\n  }\n}\n<|/recently_viewed_code_snippet|>\n\n<|recently_viewed_code_snippet|>\ncode_snippet_file_path: /Users/Shared/CLOUD/Programmier-Workshops/Kurse/Enrichment/AI/Enrichment_AI-Kurs_Enrichment/9-Website/app/page.tsx\nimport { debug } from '@/lib/debug';\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation';\n\nconst DEFAULT_LOCALE = 'de';\n\nexport default function IndexPage() {\n  debug('Redirecting to default locale...');\n  redirect(`/${DEFAULT_LOCALE}`);\n}\n\n<|/recently_viewed_code_snippet|>\n<|/recently_viewed_code_snippets|>\n\n<|current_file_content|>\ncurrent_file_path: app/layout.tsx\n<|area_around_code_to_edit|>\nimport type { ReactNode } from 'react';\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\nimport './globals.css';\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n\tchildren,\n\tparams,\n}: {\n\tchildren: ReactNode;\n\tparams: { locale?: string };\n}) {\n<|code_to_edit|>\n\tconst lang = params?.locale ??
