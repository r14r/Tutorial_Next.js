# App Router Overview

The **App Router** embraces React Server Components, layouts, and nested routing in a way that feels natural. Each folder inside `app/` becomes part of the URL, while `layout.tsx` files let you compose persistent UI like the navigation used in this tutorial.

```tsx
// app/example/page.tsx
export default function ExamplePage() {
  return <h1>Hello from the App Router!</h1>;
}
```

Layouts can fetch data, stream UI, and share loading states across entire sections of your site. They are the foundation for rich application shells.
